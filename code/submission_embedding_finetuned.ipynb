      " Easy, I got you!! I’ve been making my chai’s at home, learning from south Asian content creators/friends. By no means perfect but I’m happy with the progress I’ve made. Buckle up, this might get a little length…  Concentrates:  I recommend checking out Chai Box on instagram. They sell a concentrate that is DELICIOUS. I would highly recommend buying it if you don’t want to make it from scratch  She makes chai every morning on her story and teaches the double boil method - if you wanna get fancy. Plus you can see how much of each spice she typically uses.)   Make from Scratch:  Steps (simplified)  1) boil water in a pot  2) add spices and let simmer on medium high heat for 5-15mins (cover to maintain water, unconcerned to reduce water)  3) add tea, sit on low heat for 2-5 mins  4) add milk, honey and warm back up  5) strain and enjoy!   Use about equal parts water and milk. I never measure but maybe start with two cups water, two cups milk. Water will evaporate as you boil, so if it gets too low try adding more water. But! As it reduces, the flavors become bolder and delicious!!   Spices: (pick and choose! Use whole herbs over ground/powdered)  Cinnamon sticks/bark, dried or fresh ginger, whole peppercorn, star anise, clove Fun options:  Fennel, rose petals, tulsi, lemongrass, ajowan    -These are all great if you like herbal medicine!  -If possible, use a mortar and pestle to crush herbs and release flavors   Use tea bags or cheap loose leaf black tea (I prefer cheaper loose leaf because it brings out a stronger flavor over fancier more delicate teas). Any black tea will do fine but if you wanna get fancy; Shoot for south Asian teas like assam or Ceylon. Darjeeling should would well too. But seriously it doesn’t have to be anything too crazy.   Use about 3-4 tea bags or tea spoons loose leaf to start. Increase if you like a bolder flavor.   Here are some of my preferred brands (I usually get them at my local international farmers market, but here’s some options online):   -chai Box concentrate  (https://thechaibox.com)   -cheap loose leaf teas (https://www.davidsonstea.com)   -whole herbs/spices (https://mountainroseherbs.com)   -my preferred local herbs and spices (https://ravensnestherbals.com)   Lastly if you wanna watch people make it online, I recommend Chai Box’s instagram, or crosscukturekev on Tik tok   Okay, I’ll stop there!!! Enjoy and happy chai -ing!!\n",

      "Submission title:  Chap-stick\n",
      "Submission text: We had a home show last weekend, and multiple people from my branch worked the booth.  On Saturday this woman came up to the booth and told us that she’s already a customer, but she was wondering if we had anymore “[Bank Name] brand chapstick”. Apparently our bank used to have chapstick tubes out in the branches for people to take for free, but they stopped doing that.  Well, this lady said that she’s been using our bank’s chapstick “every night before bed” for years and that she “can’t sleep without it.” But that now she’s run out of it and needs more. She even took my manager’s business card and has now all week called around to see if any branches have chapstick!  Well today, we finally found a little baggie of about 20 chapsticks in some random drawer of our branch. But unfortunately, they’re all expired. So my manager calls the lady and explains that we found some, but they’re no good anymore, and the bank doesn’t make them anymore.  Her response? “Oh, I take expired pills all the time, my doctor says it’s okay, expired chapstick is fine!”  And now my manager is making a run to her domicile branch to drop off the chapsticks. Love when we can help a customer out, lol\n",

      "Submission text: So a few weeks ago as I was working dto, I had a girl (probably about 19-20, was wearing a college hoodie) come through and order a pink drink. But, she didn’t say “pink drink”, she asked for a “strawberry açaí with coconut milk”.   I didn’t immediately repeat this back to her, instead I just said, “Absolutely! what else can I get for you today?” She continued with her seemingly endless order for a few more minutes, and at the end, I repeated the order back to her to ensure accuracy and give the baristas on bar a little more time to prepare the order. When I repeated the Pink Drink I rang up, she flipped out pretty quick.   She said, “hey that’s not right, I ordered a strawberry açaí with coconut milk instead of lemonade or water.”   I pretty calmly explained that a pink drink IS a strawberry açaí with coconut milk — I broke down the whole drink to her when she kept insisting she DIDN’T want a pink drink because it wasn’t the same.  I let it go and wasn’t really worried about it, I had her pull up and as I was handing her the order, she noticed the label on her “strawberry açaí with coconut milk” said it was a pink drink. She started raising her voice, even crying a little.  “You made my drink wrong! It’s not the same!” I offered to remake it, took responsibility, and for some reason this made her angrier.  She told me “well I used to work at starbucks so I know that a pink drink isn’t the same as the strawberry açaí with coconut milk.”   She didn’t even let me get a word in after that, just took the pink drink (sorry, the NOT pink drink), and drove off very quickly. None of my managers were mad at me, in fact they all heard it over the headset and everyone was laughing quite a bit. One of the weirdest interactions I’ve had working at Starbucks!\n",

      "Submission text: I’m a deli closer and in my year of working at hellmart the fresh area just keeps getting worse, the deli and produce team leads hate each other. produce and meat have 1 closer each for the entire week because the produce team lead is an asshole and the 2 closers they do have are overworked and need help.  Deli has 3 closers altogether and if we’re lucky to have 2 closers the produce TL is asking one of us to stock her bananas or throw her cardboard even though we don’t have time, sometimes she just pulls one of us for the night so we only have 1 closer.  Deli is a fucking beast by itself, all 6 of our opener’s/mid-shift people are old woman in their 60s/70s who sit around all morning talking shit about the closers or gossiping about anyone they can, and god forbid you ask them to help you with a customer or take chickens out they yell at you because you “need to be able to do this by yourself”  like ok I get that but you’re here to help? They act like once the closers come in they can just lean against the counters and forget they are at work. When will Walmart realize if they want this massive list of shit done we need more people Yelling at me isn’t gonna make me magically grow a third arm, sorry coach. I hope other peoples Walmarts are better\n",

      " \"When will Walmart realize if they want this massive list of shit done we need more people\" If they did that it would cut into their bonus.  The harder you work without the appropriate amount of staff, the more THEY get.  Your reward is just more work.\n",

      "Submission text: Been in OGP for a year and a half and I'm a fairly quick picker, 6'1\", skinny, long legs and a naturally fast walker so I was kinda made for OGP.   Started off with some crap shoes that made my feet feel like death after my first day so I instantly started looking around for some better options. A few years ago I had a pair of keen hiking shoes I used while backpacking and I really liked the shape of them and how they didn't crush my toes together. So I figured that would be a good place to start, I went with the Keen Austin waterproof (I was dispensing more than picking then so I wanted dry feet), they instantly made my feet feel better but they fell apart surprisingly quick, 3 months in and I was already gluing parts back together.   Once the first pair of Keen's were no longer usable and I found I wasn't outside much at all (found my stride picking) I started looking again for another shoe. My 2nd shoe choice was Hoka Bondi 7, an amazing shoe but a much taller one and that took some getting used to, I had no issues with the fit but they seemed heavy on my foot and I was always misjudging where my foot was going to land due to the thickness of the sole. Once I wore those out I decided to switch back to Keen.  My next shoe was Keen NXIS Speed and this has been the perfect shoe for me so far, I've gone through 2 pairs and they are by far the most comfortable thing I have ever worn on my feet. I average 20-25k steps a day and I have no foot pain plus they make great hiking shoes for trails. Lightweight but sturdy and very breathable.  I just ordered a pair of Altra's so we'll see how it goes.   I'd love to hear what other Wally world folks wear and what your experience was like finding the right shoe for being on your feet and walking all day every day.\n",
